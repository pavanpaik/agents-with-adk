        "reference": "Hey! What's up? So, here's the thing: the Machine Learning community in Go is still growing, like a sprout, you know? Compared to the Python crowd, it's still smaller, but it's gaining momentum! For those who want to get into it, the tip is to focus on using existing libraries and frameworks and, most importantly, get your hands dirty to help this community grow even more. Like, imagine you want to build a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats. In Go, you can use the \"GoLearn\" library to help you with classification algorithms. Besides that, you can contribute to the GoLearn community by creating tutorials, fixing bugs, or even implementing new algorithms. Got the idea? Are you enjoying the explanation so far or do you want to know more?"
